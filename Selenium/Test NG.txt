Annotations in TestNG
---------------------

@Test -
it is a test case. (to denote a test case we use this)
When u r using TestNG we dont need main method

@Before Test
Pre-conditions

@ After Test
Post-conditions

@BeforeSuite
Pre-conditions for the test suite

@AfterSuite
Post-conditions for the test suite
@After


the order is :
@BeforeSuite
@BeforeTest
@BeforeClass
@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterMethod
@AfterClass
@AfterTest
@AfterSuite

if you have multiple tests, then methods will executed for each test.
e.g.
@BeforeSuite
@BeforeTest
@BeforeClass

@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterMethod

@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterMethod

@AfterClass
@AfterTest
@AfterSuite



Assertions

We use assertions in TestNG for verifications
